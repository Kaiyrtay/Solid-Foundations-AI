The Task — All 5 SOLID Principles, One System

What you're building:
A console-based Library Management System:
frontend.py — wiring + console interaction.
backend.py — all logic, zero console.

What it must do:

Add a book (title, author, year)
Remove a book
Save and load books from a file
Show a report of all books
Support multiple notification types when a book is added (email, SMS — console fakes are fine)
Support multiple storage types (JSON file, CSV file)


Where each principle lives:
S — Every class has one job. Book data, file saving, report generation, notifications — all separate.
O — Adding a new storage type (CSV) or new notification type (Slack) requires zero edits to existing classes.
L — Any storage class can replace another without breaking anything. Any notifier can replace another without breaking anything.
I — No class is forced to implement methods it doesn't need. Split your interfaces smart.
D — Backend classes never hardcode their dependencies. Everything gets injected in.

You pass when:

backend.py has zero print() or input()
frontend.py has zero business logic
I can swap JSON storage for CSV storage with one line change
I can add a new notifier without touching existing code
Every class has exactly one reason to change
